        <p class="text-slate-300">
          To prepare for my mid-term, which covered lectures from Week 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, I moved from just memorizing facts to organizing concepts. First, I created a brief summary for each lecture to get the main idea. Then, I built a detailed mind map that connected the key topics. For example, I linked 'Intro to Psychology' (Week 2/3) to 'Cyberdeviance' (Week 4) and 'Personality in Cyberspace' (Week 5). This visual map helped me see the "big picture"—how our basic psychology is the foundation for our online behavior, which was a core theme of the exam. This method was about understanding connections, not just remembering definitions.

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-teal-400">Reflection 1: Abnormal Psychology & Cyber Behavior (Week 4)</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            This domain was an eye-opener. I learned that "cyberdeviance" isn't just a technical problem; it's a human one. The lecture showed how the internet can make people act in ways they wouldn't offline. This concept is crucial for my career. In cybersecurity, we can't just build a strong wall; we have to understand why someone would try to climb it, or how they might be tricked into opening the gate. This knowledge helps me think about building systems that are not just technically secure, but also resilient to human manipulation.

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            This lecture on personality (like the 'Big Five' traits) and narcissism directly connects to my professional development. It helped me understand the "why" behind different online behaviors. For example, a person high in "openness" might be more curious and click on a suspicious link, while a person with low self-esteem might be more vulnerable to a scam promising a reward. This knowledge is not just academic; it is the basis for creating user-specific security training. Instead of one-size-fits-all, we can create awareness programs that address the specific psychological triggers people have.

        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Studying cyberpsychology has fundamentally changed my approach to security. Before, I saw security as purely technical—firewalls, encryption, and code. Now, I understand that the human is the most critical element in any system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mt-4">
          My critical thinking process now incorporates this "human element" first. When I see a security flaw, I don't just ask "How can this be patched?" I ask, "What psychological principle does this exploit?" Is it authority (like a fake CEO email), or curiosity (a USB stick left in a lobby), or social proof (a fake login page that looks real)? This perspective shifts me from just being a technician to being a strategist. It allows me to anticipate future threats by focusing on the unchanging aspects of human behavior, rather than just reacting to the latest piece of malware.

            <p class="text-slate-300">
              An early assignment from 'Introduction to Psychology' (Week 2/3) focused on the ethics of data privacy and online identity. We discussed the basic ethical failures of companies that collect user data without clear consent. At this stage, my understanding was focused on a clear right-vs-wrong: "it is wrong to take data without asking."
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-slate-700 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-inner">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-white">Evidence 2 (Advanced): Applied Ethics</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              A later case study in 'Psychology and Cybersecurity' (Week 12) presented a complex dilemma: an IT department wanted to enforce a highly secure 20-character password policy, but it was causing employees to write passwords on sticky notes. My task was to analyze this using the "Psychological Acceptability" principle and propose a solution that balanced security with human well-being, such as using 2FA and password managers.
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="bg-slate-700 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-inner">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-white">Reflection on Ethical Growth</h4>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            My understanding of ethics has clearly grown. I started by seeing ethics as a simple rule, like "don't steal data" (Evidence 1). The Week 12 case study (Evidence 2) forced me to move beyond that. It taught me that ethics in my field is rarely a simple choice, but a complex balance. I learned that forcing an unusable system on people is an ethical failure because it ignores their well-being (Week 15) and leads to worse security.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 mt-2">
            This growth means that in my career, I won't just be a technical gatekeeper. I'll be a problem-solver who can navigate the "grey area" between perfect security and human-centric design, making decisions that are both secure and ethically sound.

                "This research investigates the 'human firewall' by examining the link between cognitive biases and susceptibility to phishing.

            <p class="text-slate-300">
              The difference is clear. My early writing (Evidence 1) was very basic. It just listed facts from the lecture (Week 4) in simple terms. My advanced writing (Evidence 2) is professional and persuasive. Its strength is not just conciseness, but its ability to build an argument. It uses field-specific language (like "cognitive biases" and "human firewall") to identify a problem, propose a novel solution, and justify its importance. I moved from just reporting information to using it.

                In an early presentation on 'Abnormal Psychology' (Week 4), my slide on "Cyberdeviance" was a wall of text. It had 5 bullet points with long sentences taken directly from the lecture, which I mostly read aloud to the class. The audience was disengaged.

                For my presentation on 'Stress & Well-being' (Week 15), my final slide was a "call to action." It had a clear title ("Take Back Your Focus"), one simple graphic, and just three short, actionable key points (e.g., "1. Set 'Phone-Free' Zones").

            <p class="text-slate-300">
              My presentation skills have completely changed. I used to make slides that were just speaker notes for me (Evidence 1). This was a failure because it made me read from the screen and ignore the audience. My new approach (Evidence 2) is audience-centric. Its strength is visual clarity. I now design slides to be read and understood in 5 seconds. This allows me to make eye contact, talk to my audience, and use the slide as a simple support for my message, which makes my delivery far more confident and engaging.
