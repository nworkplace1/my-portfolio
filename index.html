            <p class="text-slate-300">
              When I first entered college, my goal was simple: I wanted to learn "how to hack." My focus was entirely on the technical tools I saw in movies, and I believed cybersecurity was just about learning exploits. My plan was to focus on my technical classes, learn to code, and get good grades. I didn't have a clear picture of the professional field yet, just a curiosity for the offensive side of security.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-teal-400">Current Mission Statement</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              My experiences, especially in cyberpsychology, have completely reshaped my goals. I now understand that the human element, not the technology, is the most critical vulnerability. My mission is to become a security professional who bridges the gap between technical defense and human behavior.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mt-2">
              My coursework in Ethical Hacking (CEH) and my study of personality in cyberspace (Week 5) have prepared me for this. My immediate goal is to achieve the OSCP to certify my technical skills, while my long-term goal is to specialize in building security systems that are resilient to psychological manipulation.

        <p class="text-slate-300">
          My approach for the mid-term (covering weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) was not just to memorize slides, but to connect the concepts. I started by creating a brief summary sheet for each week's lecture. Then, I made a large mind-map to visually link the ideas. For example, I connected "Abnormal Psychology" (Week 4) to "Personality in Cyberspace" (Week 5) to understand how someone's personality traits could be exploited. I used PowerPoint to create my own flowcharts showing how a concept like "Cyber Deviance" (Week 4) leads to real-world security risks. This method of organizing and connecting information helped me master the material.
        </p>

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-white text-center">Reflections on Key Domains</h3>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">

        <div class="bg-slate-700 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-inner">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-teal-400">Domain 1: Abnormal Psychology & Cyber Behavior (Week 4)</h4>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            This lecture was a major turning point for me. Before this, I thought of "hackers" as a single group. This module showed me the "why" behind their actions, connecting concepts like antisocial behavior and the 'Dark Triad' to specific cybercrimes like stalking and financial fraud.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 mt-2">
            This directly helps my professional development. When I do a penetration test, I'm not just looking for a technical flaw; I'm thinking about the person who might exploit it. Understanding their psychological drivers helps me build a more accurate threat model and explain the risk to a client in a much more powerful way.
          </p>

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            This module, especially the 'Rich get Richer' vs. 'Poor get Richer' (Social Compensation) theories, was fascinating. I learned how personality traits like introversion, narcissism, or low self-esteem directly change how a person behaves online and what they are vulnerable to.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 mt-2">
            Professionally, this is huge. It means a "one-size-fits-all" security training program is useless. A narcissistic person might be vulnerable to a phishing email that praises their work, while a person with low self-esteem might be vulnerable to a different social engineering trick. This knowledge will allow me to help design security awareness training that is smarter and targeted to different personality-based risks.

      <div class="bg-slate-700 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-inner">
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          My study of psychology has fundamentally changed how I approach cybersecurity. I used to see it as a purely technical problem: find the vulnerability, write the exploit, patch the code. Now, I see it as a human problem first and a technical one second.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mt-2">
          My critical thinking process now incorporates the "why." Instead of just asking "Can this password be cracked?" I ask "Why would an employee choose a weak password in the first place? Is the policy too complex? Are they trying to save time? Are they overconfident?" (Week 11, Cognitive Biases).
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mt-2">
          This perspective is my biggest professional strength. It allows me to see the human attack surface. I can analyze an online profile and understand that it's not just data, but a psychological profile that can be exploited for social engineering. This knowledge, from Abnormal Psychology (Week 4) to Thinking and AI (Week 9), guides my security approach. I can build better defenses because I have a more realistic and deeper understanding of the attackers and the victims.

        This section shows my development in two key areas: reasoning through complex ethical problems and communicating professional knowledge to others.

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            My initial ethical framework was about rules. I learned about the history of psychology and the "Nature vs. Nurture" debate. My understanding of ethics was about following guidelines, like in a lab, and not causing direct harm. The problems felt academic and distant from my field.
          </p>

        <div class="bg-slate-700 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-inner mb-4">

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            In my "Psychology and Cybersecurity" class, we analyzed the principle of "Psychological Acceptability." I examined a case where a company's new, highly complex password policy was technically "secure" but so frustrating that employees wrote their passwords on sticky notes. This created a greater real-world vulnerability. My solution argued that it was unethical to ignore the human impact and that a better solution (like 2FA) would balance security with employee well-being.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-slate-700 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-inner">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-teal-400">Reflection on Ethical Growth</h4>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            My perspective on ethics has matured from "follow the rules" to "analyze the human impact." I now see that technical decisions have direct psychological and ethical consequences. The Week 12 case study and my work on Stress and Well-being (Week 15) taught me that a "secure" system that harms users is an ethical and practical failure. In my career, I will advocate for solutions that are secure, usable, and ethical.

            My early writing was focused on just getting the facts down. I would describe what was done in an experiment, but I struggled to explain "why" it mattered. My reports were simple and direct, but lacked professional polish and persuasive power.

            "This proposal outlines a study to identify the correlation between cognitive biases (e.g., optimism, authority) and phishing susceptibility among students. By quantifying these psychological vulnerabilities, we will develop a targeted 'human firewall' training module. This moves beyond generic awareness to create an evidence-based defense, measurably reducing risk by addressing its root cognitive causes."

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            My writing has become more concise, professional, and persuasive. I now use field-specific language (e.g., "cognitive biases," "human firewall") to communicate complex ideas clearly. The abstract from Week 11 not only states a goal but also argues *why* it is a better approach than the current standard. I can now write for a professional audience, not just for a class grade.

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            My first presentations were just slides filled with bullet points from the lecture. I would read my notes directly from the screen. The slides were a script for me, not a visual aid for the audience.

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            For my "Stress, Health, and Well-being" presentation, my key slide was a single, powerful image. It showed a split-screen: one side showed a person's brain overwhelmed by a chaotic storm of social media icons; the other side showed the same brain, calm and clear, in a natural, offline setting. I used this as a visual anchor to discuss the cognitive impact of "Digital Stressors" without needing a single bullet point.
          </p>

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            I've learned that a good presentation is not about reading information; it's about telling a story. My old slides were just notes for me. My new slides are visual tools for the audience. By using strong, simple graphics (like the one from Week 15), I can hold the audience's attention and use my words to explain the complex ideas, rather than forcing them to read and listen at the same time. This makes my communication clearer and more impactful.

              <strong class="text-white">Psychology-Based Phishing Defense Proposal:</strong> Authored a research proposal to analyze phishing susceptibility on campus by measuring cognitive biases (e.g., optimism bias). Designed a targeted training module to address these specific psychological vulnerabilities, aiming to create a more resilient "human firewall."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-white">Security vs. Usability Ethical Analysis:</strong> Conducted a case study on the "Psychological Acceptability" of a new, complex password policy. Identified that the policy's technical "security" led to insecure human behavior (e.g., writing passwords on sticky notes), effectively increasing the real-world risk. I proposed an ethically sound alternative that balanced security (2FA) with user well-being.

            <li>
              <strong class="text-white">Cyberdeviance & Personality Research:</strong> Analyzed the psychological motivations behind cybercrime, linking personality traits (e.g., narcissism, low self-esteem from Week 5) to specific online behaviors (e.g., cyberstalking, hacking for notoriety from Week 4).
